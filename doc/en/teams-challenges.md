# Teams and Challenges

Most Challenges will enable groups of one or more *Challengers* to collaborate as Teams. In turn, each Team will typically attempt to work on one or more of the defined *Challenges* associated with a particular event, for eventual submission. In some cases the Challenges will be specified in the form of focused projects or challenge areas, in other cases there might be a single or small number of Challenge themes or topics. This platform focuses on the Challengers (the individuals and teams of individuals) rather than on the Challenges, so while we do want to account for these variations and provide some idea to consumers what it is the Challengers were working on and what they accomplished, ultimately we want to recognize the people and leave the individual challenges and events to the websites and other places those are specified and promoted.

## Highest Priority Considerations

The individual Challengers will in most cases be youth, often of minor age, and so privacy is paramount. Capturing email addresses for the sake of login and notifications (mailing list, etc) is in and of itself an issue to pay attention to given this likelihood.

In some cases there may be minor participation closer to the COPPA age cutoff of 13 years, compliance with these constraints is required.
