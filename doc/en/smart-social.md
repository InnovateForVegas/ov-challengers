# Smart Social Integration

As an exercise in project re-usability, this project will make maximal use of existing Smart Social components, as this is the intent of that project and its design (to be re-usable).

## Highest Priority Considerations

As mentioned in the [Teams and Challenges](teams-challenges.md) doc, minor participation (initially as defined in the United States), both below the age of 18 and below the age of 13 (COPPA rules), must be assumed and handled properly to protect individual privacy and avoid private communications and information sharing between minors and adult Challengers that may be problematic. Parental permission and notification for these scenarios will be designed in to Smart Social and must be used here.

## Specification Details

Integration of Smart Social features and functionality is almost obvious:

- Smart Calendar for event planning (due dates, hackathons, related meetups and online engagements, etc)
- Smart Contacts to manage individual contact information with privacy awareness, and individual profile/bio pages content, etc
- Smart News to provide a general news feed for announcing upcoming challenges and events, participants, etc

## User Stories

**Terms**:

- **User**: an end user of Challenger data, website content, etc, probably a member of the general public, news outlets, etc.
- **Challenger**: an individual participating in one or more Challenges, likely of minor age (students, youth in general)
- **Facilitator**: an individual, likely as part of an organization, enabling participation in a Challenge by Challengers, including local events and engagements according to the rules set by the Organizer
- **Organizer**: an individual, likely as part of an organization, responsible for a Challenge and associated events and resources
- **Collaborator**: an individual, likely as part of an organization, sponsoring or otherwise supporting a Challenge and/or Challengers

User Stories are implemented as [GitHub Story Issues in the Overview Repository](https://github.com/InnovateForVegas/ov-challengers/issues)
