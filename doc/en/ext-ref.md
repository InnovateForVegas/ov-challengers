# External References

The Challengers project connects individual participants (the *Challengers*) with external projects (the *Challenges*) which will typically be defined on one or more websites owned and operated by third and other parties. Integration may not be possible if these external sites are not so enabled, but a generic awareness will be essential to connect ongoing and recurring external Challenges with our Challengers.
