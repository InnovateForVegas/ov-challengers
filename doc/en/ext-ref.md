# External References

The Challengers project connects individual participants (the *Challengers*) with external projects (the *Challenges*) which will typically be defined on one or more websites owned and operated by third and other parties. Integration may not be possible if these external sites are not so enabled, but a generic awareness will be essential to connect ongoing and recurring external Challenges with our Challengers.

## Highest Priority Considerations

Security is always a concern, especially in any case where our storage of Challenger information (especially personally identifying information) might leak to these external sites for anything from account sync to publicizing names, photos, etc. The same is true of a subscription, where the external site may have less-protective policies regarding PII for challengers, which is essential to be aware of in the case of minor participants.

## Specification Details

The actual capabilities of external websites and sub-sites (some events may be part of a larger website or web presence) will vary wildly, some possibilities include:

- Subscribing to challenge/event calendar(s) directly to use the CalDAV infrastructure to maintain current status and a view on upcoming events
- Publishing to external sites related to the event, or adjacent to the event and its challenges as appropriate (ie local My Muni news/announcement publication)
- Generalized subscription to related information on an event website or its related resources (ie subscribe to a url, scrape periodically and check for changes)
