# vLocal Integration

One aspect of the vLocal project, privacy aware identity, will enable *Challengers* who are not yet 18 years of age to sign up and participate without sharing their personal identifying information on this platform. As well, this is another opportunity to make use of the vLocal platform features as they evolve.
