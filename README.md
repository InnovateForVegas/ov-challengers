# Challengers Overview

This Overview repository is a specification and documentation component of the Smart Challengers. Please do not add code or other resources to this repository.

Challengers is a portal and platform to coordinate, elevate, and celebrate those who tackle Challenges!

Individuals who would like to discover and participate in various Challenges can learn about upcoming events, form teams, and share their journey, so that they might be recognized, elevated, and celebrated, while at the same time enabling communication about future challenges and discovery by community at large (including local news media, schools, employers) to learn more about local Innovation Culture.

Note that the Challengers project may have a corresponding website with the same name for the Vegas implementation, but this does not lead to any naming requirement for anyone who deploys their in their own communities.
